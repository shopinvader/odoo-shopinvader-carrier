This is shopinvader the odoo module for the new generation of e-commerce.

This module is a base module for supporting external carrier widget for selecting dropoff site.

You must be aware that this implementation allow public user to create the dropoff site.
So information can be altered, so you should not trust at 100% the meta-information of the dropoffsite.
But the code of the dropoff site is not alterable and can be trusted, as it the only information that are used for sending the goods (we only use the dropoff site code) their is no risk that a package is delivered to the wrong address.
